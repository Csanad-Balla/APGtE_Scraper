# A Practical Guide to Evil | Web Scraper | Wordpress to EPUB
This repository hosts a web scraper written in Python for A Practical Guide to Evil hosted on Wordpress. 
Generates an EPUB file containing all 7 books. 
I made this during my spare time to read this story on my Kindle, although others are welcome to use this script for their personal use. 

If you do not want to run the script, this repository already hosts the complete 7-book worth readily downloadable [EPUB file](https://github.com/GabbyNEW/APGtE_Scraper/blob/main/A%20Practical%20Guide%20To%20Evil.epub).
